/*
  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `User` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - You are about to drop the column `userId` on the `User` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the `Appointment` table. If the table is not empty, all the data it contains will be lost.
  - A unique constraint covering the columns `[email]` on the table `User` will be added. If there are existing duplicate values, this will fail.
